	<p>The Boston Celtics started the season off slow, but picked it up towards the middle of the season.
	They have performed really well towards the back half of the regular season. They swept the Brooklyn Nets,
	who are led by two allstars in Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics seem to have 
	improved since last season and are the only team to have a sweep in the first round. This sweep is even
	more impressive due to the fact that the Celtics were eliminated by them last season. The Celtics are playing 
	fantastic defense on the Nets two allstars and their young allstar Jayson Tatum is playing really great. 
	They also have the defensive player of the year with pointguard Marcus Smart. The Celtics could make a deep run 
	in the playoffs if Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown do not get injured. The Celtics are probably the most well-rounded
	team in the Eastern conference.</p>
