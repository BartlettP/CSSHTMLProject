	<p>The Golden State Warriors are fully healthy for the first time
		since 2019. Klay Thompson, a vital part of the team's success,
		is finally healthy after three years. Jordan Poole, a young guard 
		who was drafted at the bottom of the first round just two years ago, 
		is averaging 29 ppg in his first playoff series ever. The Warriors 
		could sweep the Denver Nuggets, who have the league MVP on their team, with 
		Stephen Curry coming off of the bench due to a minutes restriction
		in order to heal from a recent foot injury.  If the team can get hot
		and stay hot, they have a serious chance of winning the title this year.
		Stephen Curry is by far the best shooter in the NBA. If the Warriors
		have the pieces around him this year, they can succeed.</p>
