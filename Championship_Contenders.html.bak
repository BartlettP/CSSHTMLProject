	<p>The NBA season has been interesting so far. There are no true heavy favorites for the NBA title this year, yet 
	there are some interesting teams competing for the title. In previous years, there were around two or three teams 
	that have loaded rosters with several allstars ,but this year there are around five or so teams that have great rosters 
	that can make a deep playoff run. There are no "super teams" in the playoffs this year. The only team that could really be 
	considered a "super team" is Brooklyn and they have had little success due to their third allstar demanding to be
	traded.</p>
