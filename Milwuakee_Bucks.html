	<p>The Milwuakee Bucks are looking to repeat this season. Although they
	did not enter the season as title favorites (they probably should have),
	the Bucks have had a great regular season. They have kept everyone vital 
	to their postseason run. Giannis has played just as well as he usually does. 
	Kris Middleton has played well too. The Bucks should easily make the Eastern
	Conference Finals as long as a team doesn't significantly overperform.
	The Bucks could repeat as long as their team stays healthy. </p>
